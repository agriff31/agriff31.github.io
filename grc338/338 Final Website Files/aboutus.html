                <p class="story">Jojo's Baking Company founder, Alexa Griffin, grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area,
                    where
                    she discovered her love of baking through her grandmother, Joanne, who she calls Jojo. Baking is one
                    of
                    the special bonds Alexa has with her grandmother and she was taught that there is a right way to do
                    things and a wrong way. Alexa always dreamt of owning her own baking company using the recipes she
                    learned from her grandmother. Her grandmother made everything from scratch, she has never seen her
                    use a
                    single cake mix in her life. That is exemplified in the taste of the goods as you get a little bit
                    of
                    home in each bite. That is what Jojos' strive to give everyone, classic flavors and a little bit of
                    home
                    in each bite!</p>
