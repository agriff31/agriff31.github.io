					<h1> About </h1>
				
					<p>Jojos' founder, Alexa Griffin, grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she discovered her love of baking through her grandmother, Joanne, who she calls Jojo.  Every Thanksgiving Alexa would go to her grandmother's house the day before and they would make all the pies for Thanksgiving together. Baking was one of the special things Alexa has with her grandmother and she continues to learn that there is a right way to do things and a wrong way. Alexa always dreamed of owning her own baking company using the recipes she learned from her grandmother. Her grandmother made everything from scratch, she has never seen her use a single cake mix in her life. That is exemplified in the taste of the goods as you get a little bit of home in each bite. That is what Jojos' strive to give everyone, classic flavors and a little bit of home in each bite.</p>
