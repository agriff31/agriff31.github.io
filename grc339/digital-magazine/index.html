                                <h3>Vegan Pancakes</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The BEST and fluffiest vegan pancakes are made with just 6 easy pantry staples you probably have on hand right now! Made in 1 bowl, the recipe can easily doubled, tripled or even quadrupled. 
                                    Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour *see notes for options, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 cup soy milk *or use almond, oat or coconut milk, 1/2 cup water, 2 tablespoons canola oil *may omit for oil free
                                    Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Pour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy. Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter. Serve with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some fresh fruit.

                                <h3>Banana Bread</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Super moist, EASY, and delicious, this is the Best Banana Bread recipe ever! It’s our favorite way to use up overripe bananas and it freezes really well too! 
                                    Ingredients include 3-4 ripe bananas mashed, ⅓ cup butter melted, ¾ cup granulated sugar, 1 large egg beaten, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, ⅛ teaspoon salt, 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup chopped walnuts or chocolate chips, plus extra for topping if desired. 
                                    Instructions: Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease and flour an 8.5x4.5-inch loaf pan or spray with baking spray. In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the melted butter, then add the sugar, egg, and vanilla. Stir well with a large wooden spoon. Sprinkle the baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt over the banana mixture. Stir to combine. Add flour and walnuts or chocolate chips (if desired), and stir just until no streaks of flour remain. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Slice into 10 thick slices and serve.

                                <h3>Homemade Chicken Nuggets</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Easy homemade chicken nuggets from scratch are made with chicken breast and coated in a layer of panko breadcrumbs. They are perfectly golden and crisp on the outside, and juicy and tender inside. They are freezer-friendly too so double the batch and store any extras in the freezer for another day. This one is a crowd pleaser especially for the youngest mouths (super kid-friendly).
                                    Ingredients: 3 large chicken breasts, boneless and skinless (about 1 lb.), ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, ½ teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 + ¼ cup panko breadcrumbs, 1 egg, 1 + ½ cup vegetable oil (only if deep frying), cooking oil spray (if baking or air frying)
                                    Instructions: Cut chicken breasts into cubes and put them in a food processor. Pulse on and off for a minute to get a thick consistency with small chunks, but not ground meat texture. Add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Stir well to combine. Apply some water to your hands to prevent sticking and shape the chicken nuggets by hand into a rounded ⅕-inch long square or rectangle. Coat the nuggets with breadcrumbs. You may need a bit more or less panko breadcrumbs depending on the size of the nuggets. For a thicker coating, dip in beaten egg first and then in the breadcrumbs. Place nuggets on a baking tray and leave in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Cook the nuggets by deep frying, baking or in the air fryer.
                                    To deep fry the nuggets: Preheat oil in a small cooking pot and deep fry the nuggets for about 8 minutes until golden, or until the internal temperature reaches 165F. The nuggets should be just submerged in oil. Turn the nuggets over occasionally to get an even golden crust on both sides. Transfer the nuggets onto a plate with a strainer and let cool for 3-5 minutes before serving.
                                    To bake the nuggets: Transfer the nuggets to a parchment-lined baking tray. Lightly spray the nuggets with cooking oil spray to achieve a crispy and golden crust. Bake at 375˚F for 15 minutes, turning them over halfway through.
                                    To air fry the nuggets: Lightly spray the nuggets with cooking oil spray and place 9 to 10 nuggets at a time in the air fryer basket. Cook at 350 F for 12 minutes. For extra crispy nugge

                                <p>
                                    With a simple spice rub, the chicken is cooked quickly on the stovetop! Dice into small pieces and serve with pico, avocado + lime!
                                    Ingredients: 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon canola oil, 12 mini flour tortillas, 1 cup pico de gallo, 1 avocado, ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves, 1 lime. 
                                    Instructions: In a small bowl, combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Season chicken with chili powder mixture. Heat canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side. Let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces. Serve chicken in tortillas, topped with pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro and lime.

                                <h3>Chocolate Cake</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This is my favorite homemade chocolate cake recipe. With a super moist crumb and fudgy, yet light texture, this chocolate cake recipe will be your favorite too. Top with chocolate buttercream and chocolate chips for 3x the chocolate flavor.
                                    Ingredients: 1 and 3/4 cups (219g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), 3/4 cup (62g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder, 1 and 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional), 1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil or melted coconut oil), 2 large eggs, at room temperature, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature, 1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or decaf)
                                    Instructions: Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)
                                    Make the cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin. Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they’re completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!) Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.
                                    Make the buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy – about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.
                                    Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired. Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled. Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. I like using a cake carrier for storing and transporting.

                                    A simple 5 minute cocktail that requires minimal bartending skills but results in maximum flavor and feels so sophisticated. This Lime Drop Martini is tart! It contains plenty of fresh lime juice, vodka, and triple sec and is finished off with a zest and sugar rim.
                                    Ingredients: 4.5 oz vodka, 2 oz triple sec, 1.5 oz simple syrup, or liquid stevia, 2 limes, ice                                
                                    Instructions: Add vodka, triple sec, lime juice, ice and simple syrup to a cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously for 20-30 seconds. Use a grater to zest lime. Combine lime zest and sugar and pour into a glass rimmer or small dish., Run a lime wedge around the rim of each glass and then dip into lime zest and sugar mixture. Use a strainer and pour cocktail into martini glasses. Cheers!

                                <h3>How to Make Vegan Cheese</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Vegan cheese is made through somewhat similar steps to traditional cheese-making. First, it’s necessary to separate out plant proteins from overall plant matter, with the plant protein sources from one of the foods above. Most commonly, bacteria is used to separate out the plant proteins. Then, thickening agents, oils, and other ingredients are added to help create a more cheese-like consistency. These added ingredients also improve the taste and, later, the fermenting steps. Just like normal cheese, the vegan cheese process requires giving the cheese time to sit, which allows bacteria to break down the plant protein even further.
                                    Vegan cheese comes in many styles, just like normal cheese! You’ll find it as cream cheese, blocks of cheese, soft spreadable cheese, grated cheese, cheese dips, and of course, shredded cheese. Shredded cheese is what we use for our pizzas, giving them a traditional look and texture.
                                    Vegan cheese tastes great, and recent advancements have allowed vegan cheese to melt, ooze, and bubble just like normal cheese. It’s coming closer each and every day to more traditional tasting cheese, and some people can hardly tell the difference!

                                <h3>Beginner's Guide to Gluten Free Baking</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Cooking without gluten can sometimes be as simple as omitting certain ingredients, but gluten-free baking requires a bit of a different approach. All-purpose wheat flour plays such a large role in traditional baking that, when you remove it, you not only need to figure out what to replace it with, but you also need to understand how those new ingredients will behave in—and affect—your recipe. Once you get a hang of the unique “rules” for gluten-free baking, though, you’ll be on your way to recreating all your favorite treats with confidence, sans gluten! Understanding how and why gluten-free recipes work differently than conventional ones will help you achieve the texture and flavor you crave. Lastly, if you need to account for a strict gluten-free diet, it’s important to read the labels on everything you will be baking with. Because of manufacturing processes, wheat can sometimes sneak into ingredients that would otherwise be naturally gluten-free, like oats, yeast, cornstarch, and more. Fortunately, if a product may contain wheat due to cross-contamination, package labels are required to let us know.
                                    First: Let’s talk about gluten. Gluten is an elastic protein found in certain grains, like wheat, barley, and rye, that, when used in recipes, helps provide structure and a satisfying chewiness. Gluten’s elasticity allows batters and doughs to trap air released by leavening agents (yeast, baking powder, or baking soda), which is how they’re able to rise. Without this protein, gluten-free baked goods have the potential to be grainy, dense, and crumbly, but they don’t have to be! The first step towards gluten-free goodness is coming up with a suitable flour alternative. The most common flour in baking, all-purpose wheat flour, has a unique composition that cannot be replaced with just one gluten-free grain. So, to mimic this makeup, you need either multiple flours and binders or a store bought, premixed combination.

                                <h3>Kitchen Tips for Beginner Bakers</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Cooking as a beginner doesn’t have to be stressful. With the right tips and practices, you can easily make delicious meals for the whole family to enjoy. Browse the nine tips and tricks below to help you in the kitchen! Reading the entire recipe before cooking allows you to familiarize yourself with the dish. That way, you’ll feel more confident when making it. If you merely skim the recipe without reading the instructions carefully, you may overlook one or more crucial steps. Take as much time as you need to look over the directions. While you should try to stick to the recipe instructions — especially if you’re a beginner — you don’t always have to go by the book exactly when you’re cooking. Maybe you’d like to swap out a specific ingredient or add more or less of another ingredient. Playing around with portions and ingredients is part of the fun when cooking, so don’t hesitate to do so. You don’t want to wait until the dish is finished to do the first taste-test — try to do this throughout the cooking process. That way, you can season and adjust ingredients accordingly. Maybe it could use more salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic or sugar. The only way to know for sure is to taste away! Just make sure whatever you’re tasting doesn’t include raw ingredients like eggs or meats. Experimenting with ingredients is part of the fun of cooking. In fact, there may be times when substitutes are necessary. If there’s an expensive or obscure ingredient on the list, you can usually find a more affordable — and tastier — alternative. Besides flavor, texture can also make or break a recipe. Many people find that when a dish doesn’t turn out as expected, it often has to do with consistency. Pay close attention to texture as you cook. It’s fun to get creative while cooking on the stovetop, but baking is more of an exact science. We mentioned earlier that you can substitute items when cooking, but we don’t recommend experimenting with baked recipes until you get more experience under your belt.

                                <p>
                                    Have you ever wondered why some ingredients seem to have a natural affinity for one another while others just don’t match? This is because ingredients pair well when they share key aromas in common. Believe it or not, but 80% of our flavor experience is actually defined by our sense of smell, which explains why palatable ingredient pairings are ones that form strong aromatic matches. What most people don’t realize is that when we say something tastes good, what this really means is that it smells good. In fact, 80% of our flavor experience is actually determined by our sense of smell, while taste and touch account for only 20% of the overall eating experience. Olfaction or our sense of smell enables us to distinguish up to 10,000 different odorant molecules associated with fragrances and aromas. Taste, on the other hand, is easily connected to our flavor experience but should not be confused with flavor. We’re capable of detecting five basic tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami.  To break down the science of pairings, remember that two (or more) ingredients are complementary when they share key aroma components. Each ingredient in our Foodpairing® database has been analyzed in our lab to determine its specific aromatic profile. These results are then compared to the other 1700+ ingredients we’ve studied to determine best matches. Each time you select an ingredient our algorithms calculate possible aromatic matches. Remember that the greater the ‘aromatic match,’ the more likely it is that different ingredients will combine well in a recipe. Use our tool to find complementary pairings, while you as a chef create the perfect balance between Taste and Texture.
