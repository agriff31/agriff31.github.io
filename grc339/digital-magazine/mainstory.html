                                <h2>Vegan Pancakes</h3>
                                <p> The BEST and super fluffy vegan pancakes you will want to make for breakfast (or lunch or dinner) immediately. Just 6 ingredients! Use your favorite add-ins to create your perfect vegan pancake! </p>
                                <p>Is there anything more mouth-watering than a stacked plate of pancakes on a Saturday morning? A little bit of melted butter on top, drizzled with maple syrup…mmmm. But if it’s a dense, chewy pancake - not so appetizing. My favorite type of pancake is the kind that is so fluffy and airy, you barely have to chew. They just melt right in your mouth.</p>
                                <p>To make pancakes vegan, you just need to use your favorite non-dairy milk and melted vegan butter. Eggs are not required to achieve fluffiness in a pancake. Instead, we’ll be using a fair amount of baking powder. Baking powder is a leavening agent that creates bubbles in the batter, making for an airy pancake. While you are making the pancakes, you’ll notice that the batter in the bowl will get pretty puffy. You can give it a gentle stir but don’t stir it so vigorously that you get rid of all the bubbles. This recipe also calls for vanilla which just takes them to the next level, flavor-wise. Seriously, don't skip that ingredient! It makes a huge difference - especially since this recipe is lower in sugar than most pancake recipes. I never really saw the point in adding a ton of sugar to pancake batter when we are going to be drowning them in maple syrup.</p>

                    <h3>Top Tips for Fluffy Pancakes:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use a really good non-stick skillet. I love my GreenLife ceramic skillets.</li>
                            <li>If the batter is too thick, add a little more vegan milk - a tablespoon or two.</li>
                            <li>If you prefer a crispy pancake edge, add a teaspoon or two of vegan butter to the pan.</li>
                            <li>Flip just once to keep the pancakes fluffy and moist. Wait until the first side is golden brown before flipping.</li>
                            <li>If you want more flavor, try adding ingredients like cinnamon, nutmeg, or almond extract.</li>
                            <li>If you cook in butter, replace it with fresh butter after cooking the second or third pancake.</li>
                            <li>Don't overmix the batter - mix until the ingredients are just incorporated. Some clumps of flour are fine.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All-purpose flour or an alternative flour product</li>
                            <li>Baking powder (Make sure you are using baking powder, NOT baking soda!)</li>
                            <li>Salt</li>
                            <li>Non-dairy milk: Use your favorite! I usually have oat milk on hand.</li>
                            <li>Vegan butter</li>
                            <li>Vanilla extract: Adds a lovely flavor to the batter. If you don't have vanilla, it's fine to leave it out!</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                            <li>Stir in the remaining ingredients (non-dairy milk, vegan butter, and vanilla extract) until just incorporated. Avoid overmixing. There should still be lumps of flour in the batter.</li>
                            <li>Heat a non-stick pan to medium heat. Add a teaspoon or two of vegan butter into the pan if crispy edges are desired.</li>
                            <li>Scoop about ¼ cup of batter into the pan for each pancake.</li>
                            <li>Cook until the top of the pancake starts to bubble and the bottom is golden brown (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
                            <li>Flip! Cook on that side until golden brown (about 1-2 minutes).</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h3>Commonly Asked Questions:</h3>
                        <h4>Can I add chocolate chips or fruit?</h2>
                        <p>Absolutely! You can add about ½ cup of chocolate chips, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or other fruit to the batter. I recommend using fresh fruit over frozen fruit.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How can these pancakes be made oil-free?</h2>
                        <p> You can make this recipe oil-free by leaving out the vegan butter and replacing it with additional non-dairy milk.</p>

                        <h4>Can I freeze vegan pancakes?</h2>
                        <p>Yes! Freeze any leftover pancakes in a zip-top bag for up to 2 months. To reheat, you can put them in the microwave or toaster.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            Have you ever wondered why some ingredients seem to have a natural affinity for one another while others just don’t match? This is because ingredients pair well when they share key aromas in common. Believe it or not, but 80% of our flavor experience is actually defined by our sense of smell, which explains why palatable ingredient pairings are ones that form strong aromatic matches.
